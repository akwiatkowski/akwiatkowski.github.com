# Hello

## TL;DR

Writing for me is not easy activity, even in my native language.
This whole website is, unfortunately, in Polish, because
creating such large amount of text in English would take much more time.

...but I want to have some url for non Polish speaking visitors.

*You can use google translate to translate posts to English, it should be accurate
enough. If not just enjoy the photos :)*

## About

Just a regular guy. I have started taking quite long ago however
I can mark may of 2011 as time of my first trip with camera. I always wanted
to explore, find interesting places and take photos of them. The problem was
_how_ but I managed to gradually solve this issue.

I have created this site to be able to manage data related with my trips,
have place to put some notes and to have one best place to share
my photos. Its engine is written in Crystal language.

## Some links

You can check: [map](/map) and [timeline photos](/timeline/).
